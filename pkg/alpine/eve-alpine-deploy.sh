# This script is used to setup Alpine build environments
# for EVE containers and produce the resulting, Alpine-based
# executable container if needed (note that not all builds produce
# executable containers -- some just wrap binaries).
#
# This script is drive by the following environment variables:
#   BUILD_PKGS - packages required for the build stage
#   BUILD_PKGS_[amd64|arm64|riscv64] - like BUILD_PKGS but arch specific
#   PKGS - packages required for the executable container
#   PKGS_[amd64|arm64|riscv64] - like PKGS but arch specific
#
# In the future, you'll be able to pass an optional Alpine version to
# the script to indicate the the environment has to be setup with that
# cached version. E.g.:
#   eve-alpine-deploy.sh 3.17
